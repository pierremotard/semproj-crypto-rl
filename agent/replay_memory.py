# Replay Memory
# -------------
#
# We'll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores
# the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data
# later. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a
# batch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes
# and improves the DQN training procedure.
#
# For this, we're going to need two classses:
#
# -  ``Transition`` - a named tuple representing a single transition in
#    our environment. It essentially maps (state, action) pairs
#    to their (next_state, reward) result, with the state being the
#    screen difference image as described later on.
# -  ``ReplayMemory`` - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the
#    transitions observed recently. It also implements a ``.sample()``
#    method for selecting a random batch of transitions for training.
#
